I am an eco-epidemiologist (MSc/PhD) and applied data scientist with experience in machine learning, data engineering, and advanced statistical techniques.

Throughout my career, I have developed predictive models, analyzed large datasets, and promoted evidence-based decision-making. These experiences have shown me how technology can drive positive change in public health and environmental sustainability.

As an active member of data science communities, Iâ€™m always seeking opportunities to learn, collaborate, and share knowledge with fellow researchers and enthusiasts.

Welcome!
